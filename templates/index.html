        <h3><b>The Monty Hall problem</b> is a brain teaser, in the form of a probability puzzle, loosely based on the American
    television game show Let's Make a Deal
    and named after its original host, Monty Hall.</h3>
    </p>

    <p>
        <h4>Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: behind one door is money, behind the others- goats.
            You pick a door, say No.1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No.3, which has a goat.
            He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No.2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?</h4>
    </p>

    <p>
        <h4>Vos Savant's response was that the contestant should switch to the other door. Under the standard assumptions,
        contestants who switch have a 2/3 chance of winning the money, while contestants who stick to their initial choice have only a 1/3 chance. </h4>
